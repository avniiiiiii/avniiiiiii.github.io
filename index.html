        <p class="sectionsubtag Tsmall">India has a rich history of promoting education, and it's a beautiful thing to see! From the oldest Gurukul to prestigious IITs and IIMs, we've got it all. 
            Did you know that our literacy rate is at 75%? 
            That's pretty impressive, right? In fact, Kerala has the highest literacy rate of 93%, while Bihar is still working on it with a rate of 63.82%. 
            We've always had a soft spot for the education of our girls, and we're happy to say that they've outperformed men in several competitive and national exams.
             We know that educating women is essential for the development of our society. 
             When a woman is educated, the entire society benefits, whereas when a man is educated, only he benefits. 
             That's why we're passionate about promoting education among girls. Let's empower our women to help our nation progress!</p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag Tsmall">Since the mid-20th century, societies around the globe have undergone an accelerating pace of change in economy and technology.
             Its effects on the workplace, and thus on the demands on the educational system preparing students for the workforce, have been significant. Beginning in the 1980s, government, educators, and major employers issued a series of reports identifying key skills and implementation strategies to steer students and workers towards meeting the demands of the changing and increasingly digital workplace and society.
              21st century skills are a series of higher-order skills, abilities, and learning dispositions that have been identified as being required for success in 21st century society and workplaces by educators, business leaders, academics, and governmental agencies. 
              Many of these skills are also associated with deeper learning, including analytic reasoning, complex problem solving, and teamwork, compared to traditional knowledge-based academic skills.</p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag Tsmall">Among developing countries, illiteracy and percentages without schooling in 2000 stood at about half the 1970 figures. 
            Among developed countries, figures about illiteracy rates differ widely.
             Often it is said that they decreased from 6% to 1%. 
             Illiteracy rates in less economically developed countries (LEDCs) surpassed those of more economically developed countries (MEDCs) by a factor of 10 in 1970, and by a factor of about 20 in 2000. 
             Illiteracy decreased greatly in LEDCs, and virtually disappeared in MEDCs. 
             Percentages without any schooling showed similar patterns.</p>
